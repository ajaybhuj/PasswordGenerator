# Password Generator App

This React application is a simple yet powerful password generator. It allows users to customize the length of the password, include numbers and special characters, and easily copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Password Length Slider:** Users can adjust the length of the password using a user-friendly slider.
- **Include Numbers:** Users have the option to include numerical digits in the generated password by toggling the "Numbers" checkbox.
- **Include Special Characters:** Users can enhance the complexity of the password by including special characters. The "Characters" checkbox enables or disables this feature.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** A convenient "Copy" button allows users to quickly copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.

## How to Use

1. Adjust the password length using the slider.
2. Toggle the "Numbers" and "Characters" checkboxes based on your preferences.
3. The generated password will be displayed in the input field.
4. Click the "Copy" button to copy the password to the clipboard.

## Technical Details

- **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` for managing component state.
- **Use of Hooks:** Implements `useCallback` for optimizing function memorization and `useEffect` for handling side effects.
- **Ref Hook:** Uses `useRef` to interact with the password input field directly.
